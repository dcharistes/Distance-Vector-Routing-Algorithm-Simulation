# Routing Process
Implementation of a simple routing algorithm aimed at exchanging distance vectors between neighboring routers. For the initialization we use a cost table that stores the information about the time cost of communication between two routers. Then we create the Next_Hop table which will record the next node that i must go through in order to communicate with j, according to the minimum cost. Finally we have Neighbors which registers if two nodes i and j are neighbors with 1 for true and 0 for false. At initialization each router will inform its neighbors about the information it has (routing table). Then, the algorithm will refresh the routing tables of each node after regular time intervals and after every change in the network topology (e.g. link-communication drop and recovery).
